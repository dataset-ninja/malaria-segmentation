**Malaria Segmentation** is a dataset for instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 883 images with 3586 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*malaria parasite*).

Images in the Malaria Segmentation dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (883 images). The dataset was released in 2019.
