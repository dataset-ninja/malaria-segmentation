**Malaria Segmentation: A Dataset for Segmentation of Malaria Infected Cells** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 883 images with 3572 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *Debris*, *Esch*, *R*, and other: *Lsch*, *LT*, *MT*, *LR-ET*, *Seg*, and *WBC*.

Images in the Malaria Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands and Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Germany.
